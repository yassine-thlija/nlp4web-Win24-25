## Problems in NLP
- **Information Overload**: Managing vast amounts of textual data efficiently.
- **Quality Assessment**: Determining the credibility and reliability of web-based content.
- **Data Cleansing**: Removing noise such as duplicates, spelling errors, and formatting inconsistencies.
- **Ambiguities in Language**:
    - **Lexical Ambiguity**: Words with multiple meanings (e.g., "bat" as an animal vs. a sports tool).
    - **Syntactic Ambiguity**: Different grammatical interpretations (e.g., "I saw the man with a telescope").
    - **Tokenization Ambiguities**: Handling punctuation, contractions, and multi-word expressions.
- **Morphological Challenges**: Correctly segmenting and normalizing words across different languages.
## Solutions in NLP
- **Tokenization**: Segmenting text into meaningful units (words, subwords, etc.).
- **Stemming and Lemmatization**:
    - **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root forms by applying rules (e.g., "running" → "run").
    - **Lemmatization**: Mapping words to their base dictionary forms (e.g., "better" → "good").
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Assigning grammatical categories to words to disambiguate meanings.
- **Parsing**: Analyzing sentence structure to determine grammatical relations.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying proper nouns such as names, locations, and organizations.
- **Syntax and Semantics Analysis**: Ensuring correct interpretation of linguistic structures.
- **Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches**:
    - Rule-based methods (Porter Stemmer, regex tokenization).
    - Statistical models (Hidden Markov Models, CRFs).
    - Neural network models (Transformers, BERT, GPT, LLaMA).
## Formulas and Key Concepts
- **Tokenization**:
- $T = {w_1, w_2, ..., w_n}$   
- where $T$ is the set of tokens extracted from a sentence.
- **Stemming Example (Porter’s Algorithm Rules)**:
```
ATIONAL → ATE (relational → relate)
[>0 vowels] + ING → * (monitoring → monitor)
SSES → SS (grasses → grass)
```  
- **POS Tagging Accuracy**:
Accuracy = $\huge{\frac{Correctly\ Assigned\ Tags}{Total\ Words}}$
Current state-of-the-art models achieve ~98% accuracy.
- **Ambiguities Handling in Syntax**:
	- Parse Tree Representations:
```(S (NP (Det The) (N dog)) (VP (V ate) (NP (Det a) (N cookie))))```
- Determines sentence structure and meaning. 
- **Semantic Meaning Representation**:
```Meaning(w) = Context(w) + Knowledge(w)```    
- where $w$ is the word being analyzed.
## Summary

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** involves extracting, analyzing, and understanding text.
- **Challenges** include ambiguity, noise, and context dependency.
- **Solutions** range from traditional linguistic methods to deep learning approaches.
- **Mathematical models and AI techniques** play a crucial role in improving NLP systems.
